# mongoose_geofence
This repository showcases how to make queries on mongodb with mongoose where, your user has saved a shape and now you need to make a search whether a point exists in there or not.
To run it. Clone the repository. Run npm install and then node app.js.   
The front end code accompanying it will be updated shortly.
